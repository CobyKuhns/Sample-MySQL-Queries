# Sample MySQL Queries
 A sample python program that creates a new database in an existing SQL server, and then makes queries on said database

 HOW TO USE:
    Run main.py in any python interpreter
    When prompted by the software, enter the Hostname of the MySQL server you want to access, and then the Username and Password of the User you want to use
    Then, enter your desired schema name when prompted
    

    The software will parse the included CSV file for entries to add to the table, add those entries, then perform queries on the data in the schema.

    The CSV file can be edited as wanted to add or remove entries

    The software will not remove the Database after running, so be sure to remove it if you do not want the information on your MySQL server.
